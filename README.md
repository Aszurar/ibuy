# React Native Expo Router Study Project

## Description

This repository contains a React Native project developed with Expo, aimed at studying and practicing the Expo Router. The project explores different types of navigation, including Tabs, Stack, and Drawer, and navigation techniques such as using `useRouter`, `Link`, and more.

## Objectives

- **Learn the Expo Router:** Understand how to configure and use the router within the context of a React Native application.
- **Explore Navigation Types:** Practice implementing navigation via tabs (Tabs), stacks (Stack), and drawers (Drawer).
- **Route Configurations:** Configure and understand routes in different contexts and layouts, such as Stack, Drawer, and BottomTabs.
- **Layouts and Links Practice:** Use `_layout` files to structure the design and navigation, as well as the `Link` component for declarative navigation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`_layout`**: Files that define the basic configuration of the layouts used across different pages and types of navigation.
- **`index`**: The main entry file for the appâ€™s routes.
- **Specific Navigations**: Detailed implementations for Tabs, Stack, and Drawer navigations.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: A framework for building mobile applications.
- **Expo**: A platform that provides a set of tools and services built around React Native.
- **Expo Router**: A routing solution for React Native apps, offering support for Tabs, Stack, and Drawer navigation.
